## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Positioning the slider right was the biggest problem for me. In the end I decided to just position it right at mobile (375px), tablet (768px) and desktop (1440px) size.

### Continued development

Finishing projects even when they are not 100% working is better than giving up on the challenge completely. I can always come back later and improve my solutions when I've learned more.

Still need to learn a lot about passing down props and using them in the child component. And also about hooks in React.
